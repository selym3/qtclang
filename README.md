# qtclang

Small PyQt GUI for C/C++ applications

When loaded up, you are presented with all the C/C++ source files in a given directory. These can be compiled.
There is also the option to compile the program file (containing the main function) and to run this file. Source files can be refreshed if they are added/removed while the program is open. The source,output, and program directories cannot be changed while qtclang is running yet.
